Behavioral: Observer

Purpose of the pattern:
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Usage situations:
It is useful when there is an object that changes its state frequently and other objects need to be informed of these changes.
